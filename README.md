# Network Monitor Dashboard

A modern, single-file network monitoring dashboard built with Flet.

This tool provides a clean, dark-mode-only UI for monitoring your system‚Äôs network details, running ping/traceroute tests, and performing Ookla-powered speed tests.

Everything runs from one file. No external scripts. No clutter.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manas-Kushwaha-99/Network-Monitor-Dashboard.git
   cd network-monitor-dashboard
   ```
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python "Network Monitor.py"
   ```

   or launch the packaged version:

   ```bash
   Network Monitor.exe
   ```
3. The app opens in a desktop window with all tools available.

> **Note (Windows users):**
> The first time you run a speed test, the app will try to automatically download the official **Ookla Speedtest CLI**.
> If this fails (due to firewall, proxy, or permissions), manually [download it](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) and place `speedtest.exe` in the same folder as:
>
> * `Network Monitor.py`, or
> * `Network Monitor.exe` (if using the packaged version).

Without `speedtest.exe`, all other features work fine, but speed tests will show an error.
